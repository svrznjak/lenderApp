# Vue 3 | Vue Router | Pinia | TypeScript X Capacitor

This project is developed as an example of deploying a modern web stack to build a simple and stable codebase that is deployable to all devices (mobile, web, desktop).

The success of this project is measured as pragmatically as possible: The app gets good reviews and accumulates recurring monthly paying users with minimum effort in development and maintenance.

## Main goals

:point_right: Build a well-structured and easy-to-maintain codebase

:point_right: Create a bug-free user experience that is "fast" and appealing to use

:point_right: Deploy internationally on all devices and make some :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:

## App idea, who is the app for and what does it do?

The app helps people who lend money keep track of budgets, loans and financial events (transactions). Additionally, the loan interest is automatically calculated to create additional added value for users.

### Budgets

Budgets are used for the separation of funds into user-defined categories (by risk, purpose, someone else's funds etc.).

### Loans

Loans are used to group data about a loan and events/transactions related to that specific loan.

### Transactions

Transactions are used to move and track the movement of value.
